Analyzing fourth down tendencies to predict when it is statistically better for an
offense to punt, kick a field goal, or when they should "go for it" and attempt to 
get a first down.  Our data is taken from the 2017 games of all of Notre Dame's
opponents in the 2017 season.  Notre Dame's opponents in the 2017 season were
Temple, Georgia, Boston College, Michigan State, Miami (OH), North Carolina, USC,
NC State, Wake Forest, Miami (FL), Navy, Stanford and LSU.
